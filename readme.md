## Win's Star 🚀

Win's Star is a project I've been working on in GameMaker Studio, inspired by the operating systems Windows and Mac. It's a game that simulates the functionality of an OS, with a mix of features from both popular operating systems.

🕹️ The game includes features such as a file explorer, a start menu, a taskbar, and various applications like a terminal, pdf reader, and more. The game also features a user interface that mimics the look and feel of both Windows and Mac, with a sleek and modern design.

🚨 Please note that this project has been discontinued and is no longer being actively developed. As a result, there may be bugs and issues that have not been resolved. 🐛 It's also important to use the correct version of GameMaker Studio, as using the wrong version may cause crashes and other issues.

🔧 [GameMaker-Beta Studio](https://gamemaker.io/en/download) version: IDEv2022.800.0.193 Runtime v2022.800.0.174

🙏 I apologize for not having the paid version of GameMaker Studio, which means that I'm unable to generate an .exe file. However, I've included the project files and source code so that you can still explore and play around with the game.
