## Win's Star 🚀

Win's Star is a project I've been working on in GameMaker Studio, inspired by the operating systems Windows and Mac. It's a game that simulates the functionality of an OS, with a mix of features from both popular operating systems.

🕹️ The game includes features such as a file explorer, a start menu, a taskbar, and various applications like a terminal, pdf reader, and more. The game also features a user interface that mimics the look and feel of both Windows and Mac, with a sleek and modern design.

🚨 Please note that this project has been discontinued and is no longer being actively developed. As a result, there may be bugs and issues that have not been resolved. 🐛 It's also important to use the correct version of GameMaker Studio, as using the wrong version may cause crashes and other issues.
